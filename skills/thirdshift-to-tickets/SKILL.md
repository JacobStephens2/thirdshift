# To Tickets

Break a plan, spec, or session into a set of **tickets**: tracer-bullet vertical slices, each declaring the tickets that **block** it.

The issue tracker and triage label vocabulary should have been provided to you. If `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md` is missing, fall back to the `gh` CLI. If `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` is missing, use the label names as written here, creating a label the tracker lacks (`gh label create`).

The tickets are all this skill writes. Write nothing to the repository: no ticket files, commits or branches. A `CONTEXT.md` or ADR change the work needs is part of a ticket's work, named in its acceptance criteria.

For **Security fix publishing**, keep every Ticket terse: say only what the fix changes and link the private record. Keep all finding evidence in that record. A private finding's issue is the parent Spec, and its existing body and evidence stay unchanged.

## Process

### 1. Gather context

Work from whatever is already in the session context. If you were given a reference (an issue number or URL) as an argument, fetch it and read its full body and comments.

### 2. Explore the codebase (optional)

If you have not already explored the codebase, do so to understand the current state of the code. Ticket titles and descriptions should use the project's domain glossary vocabulary, and respect ADRs in the area you're touching.

Look for opportunities to prefactor the code to make the implementation easier. "Make the change easy, then make the easy change."

### 3. Draft vertical slices

Break the work into **tracer bullet** tickets.

<vertical-slice-rules>

- Each slice cuts a narrow but COMPLETE path through every layer (schema, API, UI, tests): vertical, NOT a horizontal slice of one layer
- A completed slice is demoable or verifiable on its own
- Each slice is sized to fit in a single fresh context window
- Any prefactoring should be done first

</vertical-slice-rules>

Give each ticket its **blocking edges**: the other tickets that must complete before it can start. A ticket with no blockers can start immediately.

**Wide refactors are the exception to vertical slicing.** A **wide refactor** is one mechanical change (rename a column, retype a shared symbol) whose **blast radius** fans across the whole codebase, so a single edit breaks thousands of call sites at once and no vertical slice can land green. Don't force it into a tracer bullet; sequence it as **expand–contract**. First expand: add the new form beside the old so nothing breaks. Then migrate the call sites over in batches sized by blast radius (per package, per directory), each batch its own ticket blocked by the expand, keeping CI green batch to batch because the old form still exists. Finally contract: delete the old form once no caller remains, in a ticket blocked by every migrate batch. When even the batches can't stay green alone, keep the sequence but let them share an integration branch that all block a final integrate-and-verify ticket; green is promised only there.

When the whole change fits a single fresh context window, the breakdown is one ticket with no blocking edges. Don't split it to make a set.

### 4. Check the breakdown

Nobody is there to approve the breakdown, so check it yourself. Write the proposed breakdown as a numbered list. For each ticket:

- **Title**: short descriptive name
- **Blocked by**: which other tickets (if any) must complete first
- **What it delivers**: the end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work

Answer for yourself:

- Is the granularity right? (too coarse / too fine)
- Are the blocking edges correct: does each ticket only depend on tickets that genuinely gate it?
- Should any tickets be merged or split further?

Iterate until every answer holds.

### 5. Publish the tickets to the issue tracker

Publish one issue per ticket in dependency order (blockers first) so each ticket's blocking edges can reference real identifiers. Use the issue template below.

The links are native, never only text in a body: thirdshift reads the tracker's own sub-issue and "blocked by" links to order the work, and ignores what a body says.

- **Parent**: when the tickets come from a spec's issue, make each one a sub-issue of it: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<spec>/sub_issues -F sub_issue_id=<ticket-db-id>`.
- **Blocked by**: add each blocking edge as an issue dependency: `gh api --method POST repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<ticket>/dependencies/blocked_by -F issue_id=<blocker-db-id>`.

Both take the issue's numeric **database id** (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<n> --jq .id`), not its `#number` or `node_id`. Once published, read the links back and fix any that are missing.

Apply the `ready-for-agent` triage label to each ticket of a spec; the tickets are agent-grabbable by construction. A single standalone ticket, with no parent, is the whole plan: label it `needs-triage` and nothing else, as thirdshift marks it ready once the session has ended and the plan passes its checks.

Publish only: don't start work on any ticket.

Do NOT close or modify any parent issue, beyond linking its sub-issues.

<issue-template>

## Parent

A reference to the parent issue on the tracker (if the source was an existing issue, otherwise omit this section).

## What to build

The end-to-end behaviour this ticket makes work, from the user's perspective, not layer-by-layer implementation.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2

## Blocked by

- A reference to each blocking ticket, or "None (can start immediately)".

</issue-template>

Avoid specific file paths or code snippets: they go stale fast. Exception: if a prototype produced a snippet that encodes a decision more precisely than prose can (state machine, reducer, schema, type shape), inline it and note briefly that it came from a prototype. Trim to the decision-rich parts, not a working demo, just the important bits.
