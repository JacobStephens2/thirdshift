# TypeScript Ticket run prototype

This isolated experiment implements the opening half of a Ticket run for #1836
under Spec #1831. It does not replace the Rust executable or change ADR-0001.

On Linux, with Bun 1.4.4, Git and GitHub CLI installed:

```sh
cd prototypes/typescript
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run build
./build/thirdshift https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/123
```

Run the executable from the target repository's Launch directory on its Base
branch. It accepts only a canonical `https://github.com/owner/repository/issues/N`
URL: userinfo, a port, a query, and a fragment are rejected before any GitHub
call or session. It then checks Origin match and the issue's open state and
Trusted account authorship, takes the Claim, and starts `claude` with null
stdin, streaming JSON output and `--permission-mode auto`. SSH and HTTPS GitHub
origins are supported.
The executable needs `git`, authenticated `gh` and `claude` on PATH; Bun and a
checkout of this prototype are needed only to build it.

The build script invokes `bun build --compile --target=bun-linux-x64`, embedding
every file under the repository's `skills/` directory into a transient typed
entrypoint. Build output stays under ignored `build/`. Factory skills are
extracted into the target repository's common Git directory and linked under
the Worktree's `.claude/skills/`, with entries in the shared `info/exclude`.
The issue file includes only comments by Trusted accounts; other comments get
a placeholder. Worktrees, branches and skill files are retained for inspection.
This first slice intentionally fails safely on an existing Issue branch instead
of implementing Continuation or numbered Issue branches.

SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP record interruption. The active subprocess group gets
SIGINT, then SIGTERM after one second, then SIGKILL after another second, even
if its leader has exited. Claim ending runs after cancellation: a new Claim
is restored to its prior labels when neither an Issue branch on origin nor a
pull request exists, and otherwise retained. The prototype ends after one
Harness session; Delivery, CI Repair and Pickup belong to later tickets.

`bun test` compiles the binary and exercises it with real temporary Git
repositories and fake `gh` and `claude` executables, including a signal-resistant
forked Harness. Tests run the executable with no Bun on PATH. Test waits have
generous overall bounds; the one-second escalation intervals are production
behavior, not test deadlines.

`scripts/affected-tests issue-1831` selects only `tsc --noEmit` and `bun test`
when all changes are under this directory. Changes elsewhere do not select
this suite. For mixed changes, prototype checks are added independently to
the existing selector rules. Install dependencies here before using that command.
