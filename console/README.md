# Console browser tests

The Console is the local page served by the binary, separate from the public
site. Build it, then run Playwright against fixture Command records:

```sh
cargo build --locked
cd console
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm test
```

`THIRDSHIFT_BINARY` can name another built binary. Each run uses an isolated
home folder and a free localhost port, and closes its own server and browser.
Node and npm are test tools only; the release build embeds its assets.

To open your machine's Inbox, run `thirdshift console --no-sign-in` and visit
the localhost address printed on stdout. Without `--no-sign-in` the command
refuses to serve until the sign-in Ticket ships. In `~/.thirdshift/config.toml`:

```toml
[console]
port = 8711
other_consoles = ["https://console.example.test"]
theme = "focus-auto" # also focus-light or focus-dark
```

The header names this machine and links to those addresses, without fetching
them. The first page pairs with `thirdshift status`. A refresh reads the current
records; server-push updates are a later Ticket. Replacing the installed binary
makes the Console re-execute itself with its original arguments.
